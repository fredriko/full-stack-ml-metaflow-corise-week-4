We also value high throughput and low latency (with focus being on the former). BUT it is not as easy as to put a better performing model into production... Some of our customers measure predictions over time, and are thus more interested in the delta differences at certain time points than the absolute scores. This means that they value consistency over quality. When speaking to their data scientists, they obviously want the best models, but it is their business department that \"owns\" the value chain on their end and they don't want changes they can't explain, or can't re-run for a long period of (back in) time."
